<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>An issue that affects the lives of individuals globally, even within developed countries like the United States, is a lack of access to clean drinking water. Contaminants such as lead are not always visible to the eye and can be deleterious to health especially to susceptible populations like that of children. Although schools should guarantee children safe access to drinking water, recent evaluations have found schools throughout the US to have high levels of lead beyond the set threshold of 15 parts per billion (ppb). It is now well known that exposure to lead, even in low levels, has long lasting effects on neurodevelopment and cognition with an even greater effect when exposure occurs at an early age. Additionally, studies have show that disavantaged populations, such as minorities or those living under the poperty levels, are disproportionately affected by lead exposure. The goal of this project is to investigate whether childhood exposure to lead throughout New York City schools is influence by race/ethnicity or economical status, and whether schools with higher levels of exposures have overall lower standardized math test scores.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>Exposure to lead in water has been an issue for a long time that has only recently received a lot of attention due to large scale exposures related to social justice issues. A recent article from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/new-york-schools-lead-water.html">The New York Times</a> describes how flushing of water outlets prior to testing temporarily decreased the amount of lead measured in NYC public schools. Two scientific reviews related to lead exposure and its health effects are here: <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199001113220203#t=article">Review of the effects of lead exposure among children</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16611170">Pollutant Exposures Among Ethnic Minority and Poor Children</a></p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>Our initial questions were whether or not exposure to lead through drinking water varies depending on race/ethnicity or economical status in New York City public schools? And if so, by how much?</p>
<p>Due to information provided in both datasets, our questions evolved to determine whether or not exposures to lead in drinking water in NYC public schools related to state test scores (specifically mathematics) in addition to race/ethnicity and poverty.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Our GitHub repo of the steps in this analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/lizzyagibson/p8105_final_project">here</a>.</p>
<p>The compiled dataset has a total of 25 variables and it includes observations from 1116 elementary and middle schools in NYC. The racial/ethnic and poverty variables are express in proportions, that is, they show the proportion of students within a school that belong to a specific racial/ethnic category or are considered to be below the poverty threshold (based on the U.S government poverty guidelines). All schools have at least one lead contaminated water outlet, but not all schools have outlets with lead levels about 15 ppb. The standardized math test scores for each school were restricted to the average scores for all grades rather than to the scores for each grade. This way, each school has only one overall standardize math test score.</p>
<div id="data-dictionary" class="section level3">
<h3>Data dictionary</h3>
<ul>
<li>number of outlets = the total number of water outlets within a given school.</li>
<li>number of outlets greater = the number of outlets with lead levels above 15 ppb.</li>
<li>number of outlets less = refers to the number of outlets with lead levels below 15 ppb.</li>
</ul>
<div id="created-variables" class="section level4">
<h4>Created variables</h4>
<ul>
<li>lead percent = proportion of all outlets with lead level &gt; 15 ppb.</li>
<li>lead med = binary, above or below the median value of lead proportion.</li>
<li>minority = “Minority” if &gt; 50% Black, Asian, Hispanic, Other; “White” if &gt; 50% white.</li>
<li>race = categorical, gives name of race/ethnicity variable with largest proportion.</li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We initially asked whether lead exposure in school drinking water was associated with childhood poverty, race/ethnicity, or standardized test scores. Based on our exploratory analysis, we found no association between poverty and lead exposure or between lead exposure and test scores. Notably, schools with more black students had, on average, higher proportions of highly contaminated pipes relative to the other races (with white as the reference group). We further observed that those schools with black or Hispanic majorities and schools with increased poverty measures had lower test scores, and that minority majority schools were more likely to have a larger proportion of children in poverty than white schools. As environmental justice issues are intrinsically tied to social justice issues, we see minority children in NYC more likely to grow up in poverty, exposed to preventable toxins while at school, and denied the educational oppotunities that they need to thrive.</p>
